ADDRESS

========================

_TODO_: 

This repository contains two versions of a set of basic JS exercises.

Within the two main folders, "initial" cotains one of the first versions of the exercises, whereas "refactor" has the latest one.

The explanation of the exercises is as follows:

- Given an array of objects (with several keys defining parts of the same address), Exercise 1 asks for a function that prints the addresses
related to each object in various ways, depending on the type of information lacking in the keys.

- Exercise 2 asks for the creation of a class with methods that manipulate/filter the given array of addresses in a variety of ways, defined in the comments of the code.
